# Software-Engineering-Lab- Unmochon: Online University Project Showcase Platform


1. Project Overview
Project based learning has become an integral part of computer science education, providing students with hands-on experience in solving real-world problems. In order to
foster this learning approach, many university courses require students to develop software projects as part of their curriculum. Project showcase events are arranged by some
universities to provide a platform for students to learn from each other and to encourage
students to participate in the events and present their projects to peers, faculty and industry experts. However, for universities, organizing such activities on a large scale across
numerous courses and student groups presents a logistical difficulty. This software aims to
address this challenge by providing a comprehensive platform that allows universities to
organize and manage project showcase events with ease. The platform will support event
organizers in creating showcase events for different course-based projects, where students
can submit their project papers, ideas, challenges they faced creating the project and proof
of teamâ€™s work(e.g., github repositories), reflecting the stages of project development. The
platform also includes features for public and peer voting, allowing for crowd-sourced evaluations Designed to be flexible and scalable, the platform can be used by universities of all
sizes to enhance student engagement, track project submissions and facilitate evaluations.
